This is the bare bones of a Perl system to read the Japanese Post
Office's file of postcodes. The main objective is to remove the bad
formatting of the file and make the file into a useful format.

This distribution is not in the CPAN format. Everything is done by a
script which is in the directory "build". To make it, type "perl
build/build.pl". The shebang in the build.pl won't work on your
computer. You need to have Template installed to build the module
files. The source files are in the "tmpl" directory.
